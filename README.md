###Introduction
Splitpane is a layout container, which is used to divide two components. These two components inside Splitpane are placed horizontally/vertically by setting the orientation, and user could easily resize these two viewports by dragging the splitter bar. Also, like other ZK layout components, it supports hflex and vflex, and user can divide the area to three or more spaces by putting splitpanes into splitpane.
